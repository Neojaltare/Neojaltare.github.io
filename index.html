    This is where I try to bring together my various interests and share some of my work.

    Here’s a bit about who I am and what I do. I’m generally curious about most things in life,
    but at heart (and by training), I’m a psychologist.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started my career as a clinical psychologist back in 2013, primarily working with people
    struggling with addictions and other comorbidities. I did that for quite a while, but my passion
    for science and problem-solving eventually led me into research, specifically in experimental
    psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Hence, my PhD at KU Leuven (2025).
  </p>

  <p>
    During my PhD, I fell in love with electrophysiology, statistics, and probability theory.
    Then, in 2022, during the second year of my PhD, the explosion of ChatGPT into the mainstream
    completely captured my curiosity. Since then, I’ve spent a ridiculous amount of time learning
    about various topics in machine learning and AI. I’m fascinated not just by working with
    state-of-the-art models, but also by getting under the hood to understand how they work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite all this, my background in clinical and experimental psychology continues to shape
    how I think about both neuroscience and AI. What excites me today is the possibility of bringing
    all these interests together - from studying and modeling the human mind (psychology),
    to exploring the brain (cognitive neuroscience and electrophysiology), to working with AI.
    In the near future, I hope to also share some of my explorations into brain-computer interfaces
    and human-computer interaction more broadly.
  </p>

  <p>
    On this website, I share some of that work, along with my ongoing explorations into these fields.
