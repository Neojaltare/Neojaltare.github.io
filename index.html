        <h1>Hello! I'm Ketan</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal site! This is where I intend to try and bring together my various interests and things I like to work on. I am generally curious about most things in life, but really, I am a psychologist at heart. 
          My initial work in clinical psychology (primarily with people struggling with addictions, and other comorbidities) led me to experimental psychology and research. Which then spawned my love for working with EEG data and statistics. 
          Sometime in the second year of my PhD, in 2022, the explosion of applications like ChatGPT into the mainstream really caught my attention. Although I didnt really understand how models like these work, I became increasingly curious
          to find out. So since then, I have spent a rediculous amount of time getting familiar with several topics in ML and AI, and am fascinated with not only trying to work with state of the art AI models, but also trying to understand how they
          work. </p>
