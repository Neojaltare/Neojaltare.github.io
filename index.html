        <h1>Hi there! I'm Ketan</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal webpage!
          This is where I try to bring together my various interests and share some of my work.
          
          Here’s a bit about who I am and what I do. I’m generally curious about most things in life, but at heart (and by training), I’m a psychologist. I started my career as a clinical psychologist back in 2013, primarily working with people struggling with addictions and other comorbidities. I did that for quite a while, but my passion for science and problem-solving eventually led me into research, specifically in experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Hence, my PhD at KU Leuven (2025).
          
          During my PhD, I fell in love with electrophysiology, statistics, and probability theory. Then, in 2022, during the second year of my PhD, the explosion of ChatGPT into the mainstream completely captured my curiosity. Since then, I’ve spent a ridiculous amount of time learning about various topics in machine learning and AI. I’m fascinated not just by working with state-of-the-art models, but also by getting under the hood to understand how they work.
          
          Despite all this, my training in clinical and experimental psychology continues to shape the way I think about both neuroscience and AI. What excites me today is the intersection of electrophysiology and AI, especially applications like brain-computer interfaces or human-computer interaction more broadly.
          
          On this website, I share some of that work, along with my ongoing explorations into these fields.
